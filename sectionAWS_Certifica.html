<h1 data-label="aws-certificate-manager" class="ltx_title_section">AWS Certificate Manager</h1><div><b>AWS Certificate Manager</b> (<b>ACM</b> ) plays a crucial role in
enhancing web application security by simplifying the often-complex
process of provisioning and managing SSL/TLS certificates. These
certificates are essential for ensuring secure communications between
users and web applications by encrypting data in transit. By automating
many of the manual processes associated with certificate management, ACM
makes it easy to secure AWS-based applications without the need for
specialized expertise. In this section, we will examine the key
functionalities of ACM and how it contributes to the security of web
applications [28] [29] [30].<b>Securing web applications with AWS Certificate Manager ACM</b> provides an automated and managed solution for acquiring, deploying, and
renewing SSL/TLS certificates, removing the burden of manual certificate
handling. This ensures that websites and applications hosted on AWS
maintain secure communications while reducing the risk of expired
certificates. Additionally, ACM integrates seamlessly with other AWS
services, making it a go-to solution for organizations looking to
implement encryption across their cloud infrastructure. Below, we will
explore the key benefits that ACM offers in streamlining security for
web applications [27].</div><h3 data-label="key-features-of-aws-certificate-manager" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Key features of AWS Certificate
Manager</h3><div>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) offers a range of features that automate
and simplify the complex process of managing SSL/TLS certificates,
ensuring the security of your web applications. By leveraging ACM,
organizations can easily handle certificate requests, renewals, and
integration with AWS services without the need for extensive manual
intervention. Below are the key features that make ACM an essential tool
for maintaining secure, encrypted communications for AWS-hosted
applications [27]:</div><ul><li><b>Certificate provisioning:</b> ACM makes it easy to request
SSL/TLS certificates directly from the AWS Management Console, CLI, or
SDKs.</li><li><b>Automated certificate renewal:</b> ACM automates the renewal
process for your certificates, reducing the risk of expired
certificates.</li><li><b>Integrated with AWS Services:</b> ACM seamlessly integrates with
other AWS services like Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, and
API Gateway, ensuring that your applications remain secure.</li></ul><h3 data-label="use-cases-8" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Use cases</h3><div>It AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a highly valuable tool for
organizations of all sizes, especially those hosting web applications or
websites on AWS [27]. By simplifying SSL/TLS certificate management,
ACM ensures secure communications between applications and users.
Whether protecting sensitive customer data, encrypting communications,
or building trust with users through HTTPS encryption, ACM is an
essential service for enhancing security. Below are several scenarios
where ACM proves especially useful:</div><ul><li><b>Website Security</b> : ACM is used to provide secure communication
for websites hosted on AWS by encrypting the data transferred between
the web server and the user’s browser using SSL/TLS certificates. This
is critical for websites handling sensitive information, such as
e-commerce platforms, customer portals, and online payment systems.</li><li><b>Application Programming Interface (API) Security</b> : Many
businesses leverage ACM to secure APIs exposed via Amazon API Gateway,
ensuring secure API calls and protecting data in transit from
interception or tampering.</li><li><b>CloudFront and Content Delivery</b> : ACM can be used in
conjunction with Amazon CloudFront, AWS’s content delivery network
(CDN), to secure and accelerate the delivery of websites and other web
assets globally, while protecting communications using SSL/TLS.</li><li><b>Load Balancers for Secure Applications</b> : ACM provides SSL
certificates for Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), allowing secure routing
of traffic to backend servers. This is especially beneficial in web
applications with high availability and scaling needs.</li><li><b>DevOps and Automation</b> : ACM’s automatic renewal feature is
widely used by DevOps teams for deploying and managing certificates
without manual intervention, ensuring that certificates don’t expire
unexpectedly, which can lead to service disruptions.</li></ul><div>These use cases demonstrate how ACM integrates with various AWS services
to ensure secure communications and safeguard user data across multiple
cloud environments.</div><h3 data-label="benefits-of-aws-certificate-manager" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Benefits of AWS Certificate
Manager</h3><div>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) offers several key advantages that make it
an essential service for managing SSL/TLS certificates, particularly in
cloud environments. By streamlining the often-complex processes of
certificate issuance, renewal, and deployment, ACM allows organizations
to focus on their core applications without being bogged down by manual
security management tasks. Below are some of the notable benefits ACM
provides [27]:</div><ul><li><b>Simplified management:</b> ACM simplifies the complex process of
certificate management, enabling users to focus on their applications.</li><li><b>Cost-effective:</b> The service is cost-effective, as there are
no additional charges for ACM itself.</li><li><b>Enhanced security:</b> SSL/TLS certificates are essential for
encrypting data in transit, and ACM ensures that your applications
remain secure.</li></ul><div>ACM is a fundamental component in the AWS suite of services for ensuring
the security of web applications and websites. In the subsequent
sections of this chapter, we will continue to explore AWS services
dedicated to enhancing the security and compliance of your cloud
