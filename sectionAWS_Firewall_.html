Firewall</b> (<b>WAF</b> ) rules and AWS Shield Advanced protections
across multiple accounts and resources [36].
AWS Firewall Manager is a centralized security management service
designed to streamline the configuration and administration of security
rules across AWS WAF and AWS Shield Advanced protections. By
centralizing these security measures, AWS Firewall Manager simplifies
the process of managing security across complex, multi-account AWS
environments [39].</div><h3 data-label="key-features-and-benefits-3" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Key features and
benefits</h3><div>AWS Firewall Manager is a crucial service for organizations seeking to
maintain consistent and effective security across their AWS
environments. Managing security policies and resources becomes
increasingly complex as businesses scale their infrastructure, adding
multiple accounts and resources under a unified AWS Organization.
Firewall Manager helps solve this problem by providing centralized
management and enforcement of security rules, ensuring that
organizations maintain uniform security controls across all their
resources.
The service addresses common challenges such as fragmented policy
management and inconsistent security rule enforcement. By streamlining
the application of security policies, AWS Firewall Manager enables
security teams to focus on responding to real threats rather than
manually configuring individual resources. This service is essential for
any organization that uses multiple AWS accounts or requires advanced
threat protection across a broad range of services.
Beyond policy management, AWS Firewall Manager plays a critical role in<b>automation</b> , reducing the overhead of applying individual
firewall policies to every new resource. This is particularly beneficial
for environments that frequently add or modify resources, as the service
automatically applies pre-defined security policies, enhancing
efficiency while maintaining a high level of protection. Its<b>integration with AWS Organizations</b> allows for seamless scaling
of security practices across accounts, improving both visibility and
control over an organization’s entire cloud infrastructure.
By leveraging centralized control, seamless integration, and automation,
AWS Firewall Manager ensures that your security policies are uniformly
applied across your AWS environment, reducing the risk of
misconfigurations or security gaps. The following key features
