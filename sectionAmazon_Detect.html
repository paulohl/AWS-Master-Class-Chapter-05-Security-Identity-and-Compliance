<h1 data-label="amazon-detective" class="ltx_title_section">Amazon Detective</h1><div>As organizations move more critical workloads to the cloud, maintaining
visibility and security across distributed cloud resources becomes
increasingly challenging. <b>Amazon Detective</b> , a specialized
security service offered by AWS, addresses these challenges by assisting
security teams in investigating and analyzing security events across AWS
environments. Built with automated data collection and analysis
capabilities, Amazon Detective allows users to streamline security
investigations, reducing the manual effort typically involved in
identifying, tracing, and resolving potential security threats. It acts
as a powerful tool for organizations seeking to maintain a secure cloud
environment while minimizing time-to-resolution when incidents occur
[8] [9].</div><h2 data-label="understanding-amazon-detective" class="ltx_title_subsection">Understanding Amazon
Detective</h2><div>Amazon Detective goes beyond conventional security logging by offering
deep insights into the behaviors and activities within an AWS
environment. It aggregates data from several AWS services, such as AWS
CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, and Amazon VPC Flow Logs, transforming
this data into visualizations and detailed activity summaries. This
level of insight enables security teams to quickly identify unusual
patterns or anomalies that may indicate potential security incidents.
With its advanced graph-based approach, Amazon Detective not only helps
determine the root cause of security issues but also maps the
relationships between different AWS entities, such as user accounts,
applications, and resources. This allows security teams to investigate
incidents faster, enabling quicker containment and remediation of
security threats across the cloud infrastructure [9].</div><h3 data-label="key-features-of-amazon-detective" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Key features of Amazon
